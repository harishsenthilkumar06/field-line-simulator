## Overview  
Field Lines Simulation is a **Python-based visualization tool** that simulates **electric field lines** using **Tkinter** and **Turtle Graphics**. It allows users to explore **electrostatic field patterns** generated by protons and electrons through an interactive interface.  

## Features  
- Adjustable **number of electrons, protons, and field lines**  
- Customizable **simulation area and force constant**  
- **Real-time progress tracking** with a progress bar  
- Fully interactive **Tkinter-based UI**  
- Optimized rendering for smooth visualization  

## Usage 

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Required dependencies:  
```sh
pip install tkinter turtle
```
### Running the Simulation
Clone or download this repository, navigate to the project folder, and run:
```sh
python fieldlines4.py
```
### Usage 
1. Adjust sliders to set the number of electrons, protons, and field lines.
2. Modify simulation area multiplier and force constant for different scenarios.
3. Click "Draw" to generate the field lines.
4. Observe the dynamic rendering of field lines.
5. Click "Exit" to close the application.

### How It Works

1. Protons act as field line sources, while electrons serve as potential destinations.
2. The force calculations are based on a custom function that simulates Coulomb’s law, using a user-defined constant as an alternative to k (9×10⁹ Nm²/C²).
3. Inaccuracy control ensures smooth rendering and prevents infinite loops.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement real-time charge movement instead of static placement.
2. Implement better visual dexterity, with arrows and colours.
3. Optimize performance for handling larger-scale simulations.
